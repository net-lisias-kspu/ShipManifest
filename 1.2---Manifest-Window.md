**Manifest Window**.

The Manifest Window is the primary window used while in Flight.  It is separated into 3 sections.  Resource selection, Resource Details, and buttons at the bottom for additional features.

Section 1:  Resource selection.

Resource selection behaves as follows.  When you click on Crew, Science, or Electric Charge, the desired resource will be selected, and all other selection buttons will be deselected.  However, since Ship manifest supports multi Resource Transfers, if you click on fluid or gaseous resources, the buttons will act as a toggle.  you can select up to 2 resources at the same time.  A perfect example of this is selecting Liquid Fuel, and Oxidizer.  These resources are typically used together by Rocket engines, so it makes sense to move them together.

Once a resource or resources have been selected, the Transfer Window will automatically appear.  

Section 2 - Resource details

This section shows the resource selected, along with the available amount /total amount of that resource vessel wide.

Section 3.  Tool Buttons.  There are 3 buttons in this section:

1.  Settings.  This opens the settings window when in flight.
2.  Roster.  This opens the Roster Window when in Flight.
3.  Control.  This opens the Control window, where tweakable parts are managed.
