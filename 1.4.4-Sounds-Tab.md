The Sounds tab allows you to change the sounds used in Ship Manifest.  The default sounds that come with Ship Manifest are cute, but maybe they don't meet your demanding needs in your "immersive" gaming experience.  This section will allow you to alter the sounds used.  Copy your sounds to the folder of your choice and enter the path here.
