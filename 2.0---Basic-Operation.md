**Basic Operation**

Ship Manifest primarily moves Crew, Science and Resources around your vessel.  It also can control many tweakable parts commonly managed in flight, such as Hatches (if you use the mod Connected Living space), Solar Panels, Antennas and Lights.

It has 2 windows that serve as the primary interface for operations.  The Manifest Window, where resources can be selected, and the Transfer window where resources are moved around.

**Resource Operations**

In the Manifest window, there are various options in Pre-flight and in flight, depending on your realism settings.

Pre-Flight, Realism Off:

in Pre-flight you can perform the following operations:

1. Fill or Empty a Vessel's Crew
2. If Realism is off, Fill or Empty all of a Vessel's ElectricCharge and fluid/gaseous/solid Resources.
3. Xfer Crew around Vessel
3. If Realism is off, Xfer/Dump/Fill Electric Charge, and fluid/gaseous/solid resources by part.

Items 2 and for can also be impacted by Enable Resources in Preflight.  If realism is ON, and this setting is also on, then Dump/Fill of ElectricCharve and fluid/gaseous is possible along with Xfer.  Note that Solid Xfers, Dumps and Fill are NOT possible with Realism On.

**Transfer Operations**

Each Resource button in the manifest Window will expose a specific interface for that Resource in the Transfer Window.  Those Transfer Operations are as Follows:

1. [Crew Transfers](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.1---Crew-Transfers)
2. [Science Transfers](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.2---Science-Transfers)
3. [Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources)](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.2---Resource-Transfers)

I've mentioned Electric Charge above grouped with fluid/gaseous transfers, but they do differ in one respect.  You can select up to 2 different fluid/gaseous resources to transfer together, and you can only select Electric Charge by itself, like Crew and Science.  However, Electric Charge shares the same basic transfer interface as fluid/gaseous transfers.  I will include the discussion of Electric Charge with fluid/gaseous transfers.
