**Basic Operation**

Ship Manifest primarily moves Crew, Science and Resources around your vessel.  It also can control many tweakable parts commonly managed in flight, such as Hatches (if you use the mod Connected Living space), Solar Panels, Antennas and Lights.

It has 2 windows that serve as the primary interface for operations.  The Manifest Window, where resources can be selected, and the Transfer window where resources are moved around.

**Transfer Operations**

Each Resource button in the manifest Window will expose a specific interface for that Resource in the Transfer Window.  Those Transfer Operations are as Follows:

1. [Crew Transfers](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.1---Crew-Transfers)
2. [Science Transfers](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.2---Science-Transfers)
3. [Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources)](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/2.2---Resource-Transfers)

I've mentioned Electric Charge above grouped with fluid/gaseous transfers, but they do differ in one respect.  You can select up to 2 different fluid/gaseous resources to transfer together, and you can only select Electric Charge by itself, like Crew and Science.  However, Electric Charge shares the same basic transfer interface as fluid/gaseous transfers.  I will include the discussion of Electric Charge with fluid/gaseous transfers.

**Resource Operations**
in the Manifest window, there are various options for resources in Pre-flight and in flight, depending on your realism settings.

With Realism off, in Pre-flight you can perform the following operations:
1. Fill or Empty a Vessel's Crew
2. Fill or Empty a Vessel's ElectricCharge and fluid/gaseous/solid Resources.
3. Xfer/Dump/Fill Electric Charge, and fluid/gaseous/solid resources by part.
