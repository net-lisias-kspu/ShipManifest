**Configuration File**

**Note:** this page includes data that is not yet available in Ship Manifest.  The current version (4.2.1.1) contains all these settings, but the section "SM_Hidden" does not yet exist.  You will find the settings contained in that section in the SM_Settings section for now.  The changes shown here will be effective with Release 4.3.0.0.

The configuration file for all settings persisted in Ship Manifest is located in the GameData\ShipManifest\Plugins\PluginData folder.  The default file that is automatically created on first time run is shown below.

This file can be edited externally.  In the case of Locking Realism settings, you must edit this file outside the game to unlock the realism settings.  Note that while you can edit and save the file with the game running, it will not retain your changes, due to the nature of the way Ship Manifest manages this file.

**SM_Window settings**

These settings are managed by Ship Manifest when you move windows around the screen.  They remember the positions of your windows between scenes and between game sessions.

You can directly edit these values if you wish.  However, if you place a window "outside" the screen dimensions, SM will automatically move the window to the appropriate screen edge, so your windows do not end up hidden.

Then updating Ship Manifest, if you save your SMSettings.dat before the upgrade, you can copy these settings over the new settings file that will be generated automatically when the game is executed.  This can help you "preserve" your existing window positions.

**SM_Settings**

These settings are exposed by the Settings window and are managed within the game.   You need not edit them outside the game, unless you wish to do so.  One setting must be edited in this file if it is set in the interface, and that is 

* **LockSettings = False** This setting is partially managed in the Settings window.  To prevent "cheating" by those that want a realistic experience, but do not have the willpower to avoid turning off realism, SM offers a Lock.  Once this setting is set to true, it disable all the realism buttons (including itself).  The only way to turn it off and unlock the realism settings is to edit it directly in the SMSettings.dat file.

**SM_Hidden**

These settings are not managed via the Settings window.  While they are not exposed to the interface (they are hidden), they are still available for alteration, if you are brave enough to edit this file directly.
These settings are shown below with a description of their use, limits and effect.

* **SourcePartColor = red**
* **TargetPartColor = green**
* **TargetPartCrewColor = blue**
* **MouseOverColor = green**
* **PumpSoundVol = 3**
* **CrewSoundVol = 3**
* **IVATimeDelaySec = 7**  This setting controls how long to wait before a kerbal actually moves during a Crew transfer with Realism ON.  Changing this setting will alter the wait time for a crew Transfer with Realism ON to occur.
* **ShowIVAUpdateBtn = False**  This Setting exposes a button to manually update the portraits of the kerbals (in the lower right of the screen).  It is a holdover from the early days of Crew manifest, when the portraits had to be manually updated.   Since that time the event model has been further explored, and portraits now update automatically.
* **DebugLogPath = Plugins\PluginData\**  This setting controls where the debug log files are placed when you save them in the Debug Window.  If you don't like clutter around your SMSettings.dat file, then put your debug logs somewhere else!
