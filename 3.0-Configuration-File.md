**Configuration File**

The configuration file for all settings persisted in Ship Manifest is located in the GameData\ShipManifest\Plugins\PluginData folder.  The default file that is automatically created on first time run is shown below.

This file can be edited externally.  In the case of Locking Realism settings, you must edit this file outside the game to unlock the realism settings.

Most of these settings are managed via the Settings window in various tabs.  However some settings are not exposed to the interface (they are hidden), but are still available for alteration, if you are brave enough to edit this file directly.

**Hidden Settings**

The settings not exposed to the user interface in game are shown below with a description of their use, limits and effect.

* IVATimeDelaySec = 7  This setting controls how long to wait before a kerbal actually moves during a Crew transfer with Realism ON.  Changing this setting will alter the wait time for a crew Transfer with Realism ON to occur.
* ShowIVAUpdateBtn = False  This Setting exposes a button to manually update the portraits of the kerbals (in the lower right of the screen).  It is a holdover from the early days of Crew manifest, when the portraits had to be manually updated.   Since that time the event model has been further explored, and portraits now update automatically.
* DebugLogPath = Plugins\PluginData\  This setting controls where the debug log files are placed when you save them in the Debug Window.  If you don't like clutter around your SMSettings.dat file, then put your debug logs somewhere else!
* PumpSoundStart = ShipManifest/Sounds/59328-1
* PumpSoundRun = ShipManifest/Sounds/59328-2
* PumpSoundStop = ShipManifest/Sounds/59328-3
* CrewSoundStart = ShipManifest/Sounds/14214-1
* CrewSoundRun = ShipManifest/Sounds/14214-2
* CrewSoundStop = ShipManifest/Sounds/14214-3
* PumpSoundVol = 3
* CrewSoundVol = 3
* SourcePartColor = red
* TargetPartColor = green
* TargetPartCrewColor = blue
* MouseOverColor = green
