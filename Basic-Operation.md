Ship Manifest primarily moves Crew, Science and Resources around your vessel.  It also can control many tweakable parts commonly managed in flight, such as Hatches (if you use the mod Connected Living space), Solar Panels, Antennas and Lights.

It has 2 windows that serve as the primary interface for operations.  The Manifest Window, where resources can be selected, and the Transfer window where resources are moved around.

Manifest Window.

The manifest window is separated into 3 sections.  Resource selection, Resource Details, and buttons at the bottom for additional features.

Section 1:  Resource selection.

Resource selection behaves as follows.  When you click on Crew, Science, or Electric Charge, the desired resource will be selected, and all other selection buttons will be deselected.  However, since Ship manifest supports multi Resource Transfers, if you click on fluid or gaseous resources, the buttons will act as a toggle.  you can select up to 2 resources at the same time.  A perfect example of this is selecting Liquid Fuel, and Oxidizer.  These resources are typically used together by Rocket engines, so it makes sense to move them together.

Once a resource or resources have been selected, the Transfer Window will automatically appear.  

the Transfer Window is where the bulk of your work will be accomplished.  Each resource type has a specific set of tasks available to it.  The Transfer window is broken into 4 main sections.   Source and Target part selections, and Source and target actions sections.

Source and target part selection works generally the same for each resource, but with this distinction.  Since multi part transfers are possible with liquid and gaseous resources, the part selector will allow multiple part buttons to be selected.  With crew, Science and ElectricCharge, only one button can be active on each side (Source/Target) at a time.  They work as toggles, meaning if you click on a previously selected part, it will be deselected.

More on this when we discuss each type of transfer operation.
