Ship Manifest primarily moves Crew, Science and Resources around your vessel.  It also can control many tweakable parts commonly managed in flight, such as Hatches (if you use the mod Connected Living space), Solar Panels, Antennas and Lights.

It has 2 windows that serve as the primary interface for operations.  The Manifest Window, where resources can be selected, and the Transfer window where resources are moved around.
