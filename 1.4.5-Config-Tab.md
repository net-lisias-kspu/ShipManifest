**Config Tab**

The Config tab alters the way Ship Manifest operates in general.  There are several options here that we will describe in detail.

- **Enable Blizzy Toolbar**.  This option will change the behavior of Ship Manifest to use Blizzy's toolbar instead of the Stock toolbar that comes with KSP. Changing this setting will immediately change the toolbar used.  If your buttons seem to disappear when going to Blizzy's toolbar, you need to add them to the visible buttons.  Consult [Blizzy's forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863) to learn how to do this.
- **Enable Debug Window**.  This option displays an internal Debug window that Ship Manifest uses to capture messages and errors generated by the plugin.  there is an option to save the contents of the window, clear the window or close it. The Debug window is described in section 1.
- **Enable Verbose Logging**.  Sometimes, when errors occur, more information is needed to understand the nature of the error.  Turning on Verbose logging causes a large number of information messages to appear that assist in understanding where an error may have occurred.  
- **Enable SM Debug Window On Error**.  This option will cause SM to automatically open the Debug window IF an error occurs.  This allows you to turn on verbose logging, and not have to look at the debug window during normal game play.  If an error occurs, the window will pop up.
- **Error Log Length**  This setting limits the number of lines that SM will "remember".  can save some memory if you have a lot of mods and are troubleshooting an issue with SM.
- **Enable Kerbal Renaming**.  This option will allow Ship Manifest to allow renaming Kerbals when editing them in the Roster Window.  Since renaming kerbals can cause their profession to change due to a KSP design issue, this option is off by default.  If you turn it on, your kerbals can change from a pilot ot a scientist or engineer, etc.
- **Rename and Keep Profession (Experimental)**.  This option allows you to manage the profession of a kerbal.  It does so by adding ascii chars to the end of the Kerbal's name.  These characters to not appear in game, but are saved to the save file, so your professions are persisted to your game save.  This feature is kind of a hack, due to the fact that Squad has linked the profession to the name via some kind of hash.  Some other mods manage professions and renaming using a separate persist file and will not be compatible with this feature in SM.  use at your own risk.  However, when this option is enabled, there is a button in the roster window that appears, allowing you to revert your kerbals, and remove the extra characters, thereby allowing the other mods to work. more details on this feature are in the Roster Window page.
