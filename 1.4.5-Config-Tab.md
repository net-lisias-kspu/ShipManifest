The Config tab alters the way Ship Manifest operates in general.  There are several options here that we will describe in detail.

- **Enable Blizzy Toolbar**  This option will change the behavior of Ship Manifest to use Blizzy's toolbar instead of the Stock toolbar that comes with KSP.
- **Enable Debug Window**  This option displays an internal Debug window that Ship Manifest uses to capture messages and errors generated by the plugin.  there is an option to save the contents of the window, clear the window or close it. The Debug window is described in section 1.
