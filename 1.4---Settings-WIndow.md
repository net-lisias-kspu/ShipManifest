3. Toolbars
4. Sounds
5. Config

Realism Tab.
Ship Manifest offers you the ability to tailor the way it behaves to meet the need of many different playing styles.  Some players demand a realistic playing environment, and do not wish to take advantage of what would not be realistically possible in "real Life".  Other players simply want to play the game, and wish to use "cheats" if you will, to make the gaming experience more enjoyable, and to overcome failures when learning different features of the game.

Ship Manifest offers in the Realism section the means to limit what you can do with the mod.

The different options are described in detail below:
