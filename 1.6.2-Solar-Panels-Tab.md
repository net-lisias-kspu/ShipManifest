Control Window, Solar Panels Tab

The Solar Panels Tab lists all deployable solar panels on your vessel.

Retracting a solar panel will stow that part, and no electricity will be generated from that panel.  Extending a panel will deploy it, and allow electricity to be generated when exposed to the suns rays.

When you mouse over a Solar Panel in the Solar Panels Tab, the corresponding Solar Panel on your vessel is highlighted.  This makes it easier to find a particular Solar Panel from the Control Window.

At the bottom of the Tab control, there are two buttons for Extending / Retracting all Solar Panels.
