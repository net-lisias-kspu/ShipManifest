**Accessing Ship Manifest**

Ship Manifest supports both the Stock KSP toolbar and Blizzy's Toolbar, a popular mod used by many.  By default, Ship Manifest has the stock toolbar enabled so, icons will appear when in the Space Center, and when in flight.  Using Blizzy's toolbar is described below.

**Access from the Space Center**.

Ship Manifest allows access to the [Settings window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.4---Settings-Window) and the [Roster window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.5---Roster-Window) from the Space Center.  This allows you to make changes to the behavior of Ship Manifest, and to manage your Kerbals from outside a flight.

When selected, icons will change color and the windows will appear.  Clicking on the icon again will close the window.

**Access in Flight**.

From Flight, a different icon will appear (third from left).

When clicked, it will change color as well and the [Manifest Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.2---Manifest-Window) will appear. Clicking on the icon again will close the window.

**Blizzy Toolbar Support**

SM supports using Blizzy's Toolbar mod.  IMHO, it is far superior to the stock toolbar in every way.  To use Blizzy's toolbar instead of the Stock toolbar, Select Enable Blizzy Toolbar in the [Config Tab](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.4.5-Config-Tab) of the Settings Window. SM will remember this setting, so you will not have to select it again, unless you deselect it some time in the future.  

Selecting this option will immediately make the stock button disappear.  If you have previously set SM up in Blizzy's toolbar the icon will appear immediately as well.  However, if you have not previously set up Blizzy's Toolbar to display SM, then you will have to add the SM Icon(s) to it.  

**Setting up SM for first time Use with Blizzy's Toolbar**

The Blizzy Toolbar is highly configurable, so it does not automatically display a mod icon (button) unless you tell it you want to see it.  This only has to be performed once per scene.

To the right of Blizzy's toolbar is an arrow pointing down.  Click on it and select Configure Visible Buttons:

A selection window will appear with a list of all possible mod icons that could be added to Blizzy's toolbar in that particular Scene.

Select SM from the list, click the close button in the lower right of the visibility window and you are done.  Blizzy's toolbar will remember this setting for this Scene.  You will need to perform these steps in both the Flight scene and in the Space Center scene for first time use only.  After that, the buttons will appear the moment you select the Blizzy's toolbar from the SM Settings window.
