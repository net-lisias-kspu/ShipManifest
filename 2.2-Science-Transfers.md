**Science Transfers**  
![](http://i.imgur.com/EK87NS9.png)

Science Transfers are available when Enable Science Xfers is ON in Settings.  Science Transfers can only be performed from Source to Target.   No bidirectional Transfers are possible as in other resources.

The left Action section shows the Experiments that can be transferred.  If the science count is > 0, then a button named "Xfer" appears.  If realism is on and the Experiment is marked DataIsCollectable (part field set by the part maker or a Module manager config), or if realism is off, then the Xfer button will be Active.  if data cannot be transferred, the button will be "grayed out", and the tooltip (if tooltips are active) will explain the reason that data cannot be transferred.

**Transferring Science**  
To transfer Science, Select a Source and target Part.  The science modules that can transfer and receive science will appear in the Source and target Action areas.  In the source area, an Xfer button will appear for each experiment module in the selected part.   In the target section, a Recv button will appear for each container module in the part.  if only one container module exists in the selected target part, then the Recv button will automatically be selected. 

Then simply click on the Xfer button for each experiment module.  The science counts will automatically update.  Done.
