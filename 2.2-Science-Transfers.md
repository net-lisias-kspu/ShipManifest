**Science Transfers**  
![](http://i.imgur.com/EK87NS9.png)

Science Transfers are available when Enable Science Xfers is ON in Settings.  Science Transfers can only be performed from Source to Target.   No bidirectional Transfers are possible as in other resources.

The left Action section shows the Experiments that can be transferred.  If the science count is > 0, then a button named "Xfer" appears.  If realism is on and the Experiment is marked dataiscollectable (set by the part maker or a Module manager config), or if realism is off, then the Xfer button will be Active.  if data cannot be transferred, the button will be "grayed out", and the tooltip (if tooltips are active) will explain the reason that data cannot be transferred.

**Science Transfer Steps**

To transfer Science simply click on the Xfer button.  Done.
