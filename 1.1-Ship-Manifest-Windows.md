**Ship Manifest Windows**

Ship Manifest contains the following Windows

1. [Manifest Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.2---Manifest-Window)
2. [Transfer Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.3---Transfer-Window)
3. [Settings Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.4---Settings-Window)
4. [Roster Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.5---Roster-Window)
5. [Control Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.6-Control-Window)
6. [Debug Window](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/ShipManifest/wiki/1.7-Debug-Window)


- The Manifest window is accessed from the Toolbar Icon when in Flight.
- The Transfer window is accessed from the Manifest Window when a resource is selected
- The Setting window is accessed from the toolbar when in the space center and from the manifest window when in flight.
- the Roster window is accessed from the toolbar when in the space center and from the manifest window when in flight.
- The Control window is access from the Manifest window when in flight.
- the Debug window is accessed from the Settings Window when in Space Center or in Flight.  Also appears if there is an error and the Enable SM Debug Window On Error is set in Settings.

All windows contain a button at the upper right of the window.  This button closes the window.

**ToolTips**  
All windows have the ability to show tooltips for certain buttons and objects.  Tooltips are enabled in settings under tooltips.  When enabled, helpful hints are provided in how to use certain features across Ship Manifest.  While these hints are quite helpful, and provide information to explain certain behavior based on the options chosen in Settings, they by an annoyance to "seasoned" users.  So they can be disabled on a window by window and inc some cases on a tab by tab basis in Settings.  

Sometimes, what appears to be a bug, may actually be a feature, and the tooltips can help with explaining the state of a button.
