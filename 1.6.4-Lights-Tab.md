The Lights Tab lists all Lights on your vessel.

You can turn on or off an individual light on your vessel.

When you mouse over a Light in the Lights Tab, the corresponding Light on your vessel is highlighted.  This makes it easier to find a particular Light from the Control Window.

At the bottom of the Tab control, there are two buttons for turning ON/OFF all Lights.
