Accessing Ship Manifest

Ship Manifest supports both the Stock KSP toolbar and Blizzy's Toolbar, a popular mod used by many.  By default, Ship Manifest has the stock toolbar enabled so, icons will appear when in the Space Center, and when in flight.

Space Center Access.

Ship Manifest allows access to the Settings window and the Roster window from the Space Center.  This allows you to make changes to the behavior of Ship Manifest, and to manage your Kerbals from outside a flight.
