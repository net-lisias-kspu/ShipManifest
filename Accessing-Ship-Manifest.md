Accessing Ship Manifest

Ship Manifest supports both the Stock KSP toolbar and Blizzy's Toolbar, a popular mod used by many.  By default, Ship Manifest has the stock toolbar enabled so, icons will appear when in the Space Center, and when in flight.  Using Blizzy's toolbar is beyond the scope of this wiki, but switching to it will be discussed in the Settings Window features.

Space Center Access.

Ship Manifest allows access to the Settings window and the Roster window from the Space Center.  This allows you to make changes to the behavior of Ship Manifest, and to manage your Kerbals from outside a flight.

When selected, icons will change color and the windows will appear.  Clicking on the icon again will close the window.

From Flight, a different icon will appear (third from left).

When clicked, it will change color as well and the Manifest Window will appear. Clicking on the icon again will close the window.
