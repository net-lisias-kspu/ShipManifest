The Hatches tab is available when CLS is installed and Enabled in Settings.

Hatches separate your spaces in your vessel.  Closing a hatch will prevent a kerbal from being xferred to another part, if that hatch is between the source and destination part.

When you mouse over a hatch item in the Hatches Tab, the corresponding Docking Port part on your vessel is highlighted.  This makes it easier to find a particular hatch from the Control Window.

At the bottom of the Tab control, there are two buttons for opening all hatches and closing all hatches.
