Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources) are a very powerful means to manage vessels in flight.

Realism Mode affects Resource transfers as follows:  
_Realism ON_:
- Solid Fuels cannot be transferred.
- Transfers will take time, based on the set flow rate, and the maximum flow time set in Settings.
- Pump sounds will be played during the transfer operation.
- Transfers respect the CanBeTransferred Flag (set in a part's config or a Module manager config).  if False, no Xfer.

_Realism Off_:  
- Solid Fuels can be transferred, and will appear in the Resource selection list in the Manifest Window.
- Transfers will occur immediately. (No waiting)
- No sounds will be played.
- All resources can be transferred, regardless of the CanBeTransferred flag.
