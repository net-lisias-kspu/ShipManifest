**Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources)**

Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources) are a very powerful means to manage vessels in flight.

With realism ON, Solid Fuels cannot be transferred, and parts that contain only solid fuels will not be displayed.  With realism Off, Solid Fuels may be transferred to other Solid Fuel parts.

All other resources may be transferred with realism on or off.

**Electric Charge vs Other resources, and multi-resource transfers.**

The Resource Transfer operations support multi-resource, and multi part transfers.   This means you can move up to 2 resources in a 1:N, N:N, or N:1 parts arrengement.
