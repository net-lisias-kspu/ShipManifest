Resource Transfers (Electric Charge and fluid/gaseous resources) are a very powerful means to manage vessels in flight.

Realism Mode affects Resource transfers as follows:  
_Realism ON_:
1. Solid Fuels cannot be transferred.  
2. Transfers will take time, based on the set flow rate, and the maximum flow time set in Settings.  
3. Pump sounds will be played during the transfer operation.  
4. Transfers respect the CanBeTransferred Flag (set in a part's config or a Module manager config).  if False, no Xfer.  

_Realism Off_:  
1. Solid Fuels can be transferred, and will appear in the Resource selection list in the Manifest Window.  
2. Transfers will occur immediately. (No waiting)  
3. No sounds will be played.  
4. All resources can be transferred, regardless of the CanBeTransferred flag.

The Resource Transfer operations support multi-resource, and multi part transfers.   This means you can move up to 2 resources in a 1:N, N:N, or N:1 parts arrangement.
