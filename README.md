## Description

Ship Manifest is a tool to manage your ship's "things", descending from [vXSovereignXv](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/22930-vxsovereignxv/)'s [Crew Manifest](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22664-*).

Crew management and transfers are now only a small part of what Ship Manifest can do.

It can transfer Crew, Science, and Resources between parts within your ship or station. It also manages docked vessel refuelling, hatches, deployable solar panels, antennas, and lights. Kinda like your ship's bridge...

Ship Manifest has a LOT of flexibility and a lot of options. By default it is set to "Realism" mode which means transfers cost energy, take time, and honour cross-feed rules. If Connected Living Space is installed, Crew transfers are limited by living spaces.

So much more is available that is NOT seen in the default configuration that you may be missing out on a lot of what Ship Manifest has to offer. Go to the Settings Window to see the plethora of options that are available and play around with them. You will be surprised at the number of features that exist in this tool. You can configure SM to be pretty much exactly what you want. You want a "realistic" experience? Check. You want to be a god and chafe at realism mode restrictions? Check.

Even so there's bound to be something missing, so please raise a feature request for anything you'd like to see in this mod!
