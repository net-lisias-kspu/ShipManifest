ToolTips Tab

The ToolTips tab allows you to tailor your help experience.  WHen first learning about Ship manifest, there are a myriad of features and hidden capabilities.  Tooltips help you with how Ship Manifest works and what certain buttons, toggles etc. do.

You can turn on and off tooltips in general, or turn on/off tooltips for certain windows.   If you are very familiar with the transfer window, but seldom use the Roster window, leaving tooltips on for the Roster Window makes sense, while leaving them on for the transfer window may just be "annoying".  Tailor these to meet your needs.
