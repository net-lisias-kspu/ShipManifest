**Welcome to the Ship Manifest Wiki!**

Ship Manifest is a tool to manage your ship's "things".

I started with Crew Manifest as a basis for this work, with great thanks to vXSovereignXv for creating Crew Manifest, and Sarbian for contributions to Crew Manifest.

I've now re-imagined it into Ship Manifest, using the same easy to navigate system that vXSovereignXv used.  It does what crew manifest does, only better, plus a whole lot more. Ship Manifest moves crew, Science and Resources around  from part to part within your ship or station.
