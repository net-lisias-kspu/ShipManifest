**Welcome to the Ship Manifest Wiki!**

Ship Manifest is a tool to manage your ship's "things".  Originally based on Crew Manifest, Ship Manifest moves crew, Science and Resources around from part to part within your vessel, as well as controlling Hatches, Solar Panels, Antennas & Lights.

Ship Manifest has a LOT of flexibility and a lot of options.  So much is available that is NOT seen in a default installation (Realism mode set ON by default) that you may be missing a lot of what SM has to offer.   Please go through this wiki to see what is available.   You will be surprised at what this tool can do for your gameplay.  I believe in choice, so you can configure SM to be pretty much exactly what you want.  You want a "realistic" experience?  Check.   You want to be a god and chafe at realism mode restrictions?  Check.

I also invite suggestions for things you would like to see.

**Mod Compatibility:**   
Ship Manifest is Mod independent.  No other mods are required.  SM is compatible with and is not known to conflict with all known mods.  However, SM has been coded specifically to support and can take advantage of the following mods: 
- [Toolbar](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863), by blizzy78.  This plugin is an alternative for and can be used in addition to the stock toolbar.
- [Connected Living Spaces (CLS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70161), by codepoet.  This plugin provides the player with graphical information on livable spaces in a ship.  It shows you where you could go internally on your ship.
- [Remote Tech 2](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305).  RemoteTech is a modification which overhauls the unmanned space program. It does this by requiring unmanned vessels have a connection to Kerbal Space Center (KSC) to be able to be controlled. This adds a new layer of difficulty that compensates for the lack of live crew members.
- [Module Manager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219).   This plugin allow you to extend the configurations on your parts.  Used by CLS.
- [KSP-AVC](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).  This plugin checks your installed mod versions against the mod's latest version.  Let's you know when you need to update.
- [CKAN](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067).  The Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (CKAN) Package Manager (CKAN) manages nearly all your mods from one clean executable.  Performs installs, updates, and uninstalls of your mods automatically.
