Transfer Window

The Transfer Window is where the bulk of your work will be accomplished.  Each resource type has a specific set of tasks available to it.  The Transfer window is broken into 4 main sections.   Source and Target part selections, and Source and target actions sections.

Source and target part selection works generally the same for each resource, but with this distinction.  Since multi part transfers are possible with liquid and gaseous resources, the part selector will allow multiple part buttons to be selected.  With crew, Science and Electric Charge, only one button can be active on each side (Source/Target) at a time.  They work as toggles, meaning if you click on a previously selected part, it will be deselected.

More on this when we discuss each type of transfer operation.
