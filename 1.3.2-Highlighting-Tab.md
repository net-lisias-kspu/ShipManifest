Highlighting Tab

The Highlighting Tab controls highlighting behavior when viewing selected resources and parts in Ship Manifest.

- **Enable Highlighting**.  This option turns on or off highlighting in general.  If off, no visual queue will be given as to which parts contain a given resource, or which parts have been selected from the Source and target lists. If On, all parts that contain a selected resource are highlighted.  Selected Source and target parts are highlighted in different colors to make them easy to identify.
- **Highlight Only Source / Target Parts**.  With Enable Highlighting on, this setting restricts highlighting to only the selected source and selected target parts in the Transfer window.  No other parts will be highlighted.
- **Enable CLS Highlighting**. With Enable Highlighting on, this setting enables Connected Living Space (CLS) aware highlighting.  CLS will highlight all parts except the selected source and target parts.  This provides for a robust look at your vessel and the livable/ passable spaces contained in it.
