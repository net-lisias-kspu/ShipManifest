**SMInterface.dll**  

(Deprecated, No longer used.  Replaced by SMWrapper.cs reflection class for inclusion in devloper code.)

Ship Manifest provides an interface to allow for detection of Crew transfers in progress.  Realism Mode introduces a delay (7 second default) that freezes the interface until the completion of the transfer process.  This can cause issues with other mods that manipulate kerbals.  if the user initiates a change that affects the kerbal being moved, a race condition can occur, and cause "duplicate" or ghost kerbals to exist.

This interface exposes the details of the transfer and provides notification of when a transfer is in progress.

The code for the dll is shown as follows:

    using System;
    using System.Reflection;
    using System.Linq;

    namespace ShipManifest
    {
        public interface ICrewTransfer
        {
            bool CrewXferActive { get; set; }
            bool IsStockXfer { get; }
            bool OverrideStockCrewXfer { get; }
            double CrewXferDelaySec { get; }
            bool IsSeat2SeatXfer { get; }
            double Seat2SeatXferDelaySec { get; }

            bool IvaDelayActive { get; }

            Guid XferVesselID { get; }

            Part FromPart { get; }
            Part ToPart { get; }

            ProtoCrewMember FromCrewMember { get; }
            ProtoCrewMember ToCrewMember { get; }

            InternalSeat FromSeat { get; }
            InternalSeat ToSeat { get; }
        }

        public static class SMInterface
        {
            private static bool _smChecked = false;
            private static bool _smInstalled = false;
            public static bool IsSMInstalled
            {
                get
                {
                    if (!_smChecked)
                    {
                        string assemblyName = "ShipManifest";
                        var assemblies = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies();
                        var assembly = (from a in assemblies
                                        where a.FullName.Contains(assemblyName)
                                        select a).SingleOrDefault();
                        if (assembly != null)
                            _smInstalled = true;
                        else
                            _smInstalled = false;
                        _smChecked = true;
                    }
                    return _smInstalled;
                }
            }
            public static ICrewTransfer GetCrewTransfer()
            {
                ICrewTransfer _ISMobj = null;
                Type SMAddonType = AssemblyLoader.loadedAssemblies.SelectMany(a => a.assembly.GetExportedTypes()).SingleOrDefault(t => t.FullName == "ShipManifest.TransferCrew");
                if (SMAddonType != null)
                {
                    object crewTransferObj = SMAddonType.GetProperty("Instance", BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static).GetValue(null, null);
                    _ISMobj = (ICrewTransfer)crewTransferObj;
                }
                return _ISMobj;
            }
        }
    }

**Accessing SMInterface**

The SMInterface.dll is designed to reside in your plugins folder.  Create a reference to the dll, and then make a call to interrogate the provided bool _IsSMInstalled_ to determine if Ship Manifest is installed.  Once you have established that ShipManifest is installed you can then call _GetCrewTransfer()_ to obtain an instance of the ICrewTransfer Object for your use.

Sample Code:

    ShipManifest.ICrewTransfer SMObject = null;
    bool IsSMCrewXferActive = false
    if (ShipManifest.SMInterface.IsSMInstalled)
    {
        //Perform your work here
        SMObject = SMInterface.GetCrewTransfer();
        IsSMCrewXferActive = SMObject.CrewXferActive;
    }


**ICrewTransfer interface**

This interface exposes several properties for third party mod use.  They are explained below.

* **CrewXferActive { get; set; }**  This flag indicates when a transfer is in progress.
* **IsStockXfer { get; }**  This flag indicates if the transfer was initiated by the Stock Crew Transfer interface.  It stays enabled during the Crew Transfer Process (just like CrewXferActive)
* **OverrideStockCrewXfer { get; }**  This flag indicates if SM is overriding the Stock Crew Transfer process.
* **CrewXferDelaySec { get; }**  This is the number of seconds delay used for the transfer in progress
* **IsSeat2SeatXfer { get; }**  This flag indicates if the transfer is Seat 2 seat, i.e. within the same part.
* **Seat2SeatXferDelaySec { get; }**  This is the number of seconds used for Seat2seat transfer delays
* **IvaPortraitDelay { get; }**  This stores the number of frames that have passed since transfer has completed.  In order for the portraits to update properly, a wait period is needed to allow for unity/ksp async callbacks to complete after crew are moved.  This is currently hard coded at 20 Frames (update cycles).  I then fire an OnVesselChanged event to refresh the portraits.  
* **IvaDelayActive { get; }**  This flag indicates the IVA delay is active.  This means that the transfer has occurred (kerbals have actually moved) and we are cleaning up portraits.
* **XferVesselID { get; }**  This is the vessel id for the transfer in question
* **FromPart { get; }**  This is the part from which the kerbal is being transferred.
* **ToPart { get; }**  This is the part to which the kerbal is being transferred.  It can be the same as the source (Seat2Seat transfers).
* **FromCrewMember { get; }**  This is the crew member being transferred.
* **ToCrewMember { get; }**  This is the crew member that would be swapped if the target seat is occupied.  can be null.
* **FromSeat { get; }**  This is the part seat where the kerbal is being moved from.  In the case of parts with no internal view, it can be null.
* **ToSeat { get; }**  This is the part seat where the kerbal is being moved to.  In the case of parts with no internal view, it can be null.

You can cancel a transfer in progress by setting the CrewXferActive flag to false, as long as the IvadelayActive Flag is also false.
