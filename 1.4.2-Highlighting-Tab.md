**Highlighting Tab**

The Highlighting Tab controls highlighting behavior when viewing selected resources and parts in Ship Manifest.

- **Enable Highlighting**.  This option turns on or off highlighting in general.  If off, no visual queue will be given as to which parts contain a given resource, or which parts have been selected from the Source and target lists. If On, all parts that contain a selected resource are highlighted.  Selected Source and target parts are highlighted in different colors to make them easy to identify.
- **Highlight Only Source / Target Parts**.  With Enable Highlighting on, this setting restricts highlighting to only the selected source and selected target parts in the Transfer window.  No other parts will be highlighted.
- **Enable CLS Highlighting**. With Enable Highlighting on, this setting enables Connected Living Space (CLS) aware highlighting.  CLS will highlight all parts except the selected source and target parts.  This provides for a robust look at your vessel and the livable/ passable spaces contained in it.
- **Enable Edge Highlighting (On Mouse Overs)**. With Enable Highlighting on, this setting enables Edge highlighting on all mouse overs.  Edge highlighting is a new feature of KSP 0.90.  This provides for a highly visible means to identify parts when you mouse over a part in the Transfer Window, or in any of the tabs in the Control Window.  Even in a busy station or vessel, edge highlighting makes finding the part easy.  To use this feature, you must also have Edge highlighting enabled in KSP's settings.

Highlight Only Source / Target Parts and Enable CLS Highlighting are mutually exclusive.  If you select one the other will be disabled.
