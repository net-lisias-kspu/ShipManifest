**Roster Window**

The Roster window is accessible from either the toolbar in the Space Center, or from a button on the Manifest window when in flight.  It provides you a means to edit your kerbals.   Things like stupidity, courage, gender, profession and even their name can be altered, depending on your settings.  

If your realism settings are off, you can add a kerbal to your ship in flight .  You can also remove a kerbal from a vessel in flight as well.

You can only edit kerbals that are Available.  If you have dead or missing kerbals, you can "resurrect them" and make them available again.

**Add a Kerbal to an Active Vessel**  
You must have Realism off and be in Flight to perform this action.  To add a kerbal, be sure you have a kerbal with a status of available.  There will be an Add button to the right of the Edit button. Select Crew in the Manifest Window.  In the source part list, select the part where you want the kerbal to go.  The Add button will now Activate.  Click Add.  The kerbal will now be assigned to the vessel, and the Portraits will update.

The kerbal will be removed from your ship, the portraits will update, and the Kerbal will be marked available in the Roster.

**Create a Kerbal**  
To Create a Kerbal, click on Create.  You will be presented with a Choice of professions to chose from.  Click the profession you want and then click Create.  The create Kerbal Section appear below the Roster List.  If Enable Kerbal Renaming is ON, then the Kerbal's Name will appear in a text box.  If not, then you will see the name as a label, and it will not be editable.

If Rename with profession is on, the editor will give you the option to change the profession.  If not, the profession will be a label and cannot be changed.  Edit the properties, and click Apply.

**Editing a Kerbal**  
Editing a kerbal requires that the Kerbal be in Available status in the Roster, which enables the Edit button.  Click on Edit, and the Edit section appears (Looks just like the Create section above).  change the properties to what you desire and click Apply.

**Notes on Renaming a Kerbal**  
Enable Renaming Kerbals must be enabled in settings to use this feature.  Renaming kerbals will result in their profession changing, depending on the name chosen.  KSP uses a hash of some kind, based on the Kerbal's name to determine the profession used.   The profession is NOT persisted to the game save, so this allows them to assign the profession without the need for this information being in the game save.

To rename a Kerbal they must be in Available status in the Roster, which enables the Edit button.  Click on Edit, and the Edit section appears (Looks just like the Create section above).  change the name to what you desire and click Apply.

**Notes on Changing Professions**  
If you wish to retain your profession when you change the name or just want to be able to change the profession of an existing kerbal, then Enable Rename with Profession must be enabled.  Note that when you change professions, in order to retain the name, I use non printing characters (Ascii "1"s) added to the end of the name to "fool" the hash based profession generator built into KSP to pick the desired profession.  While this causes no issues with the game, it will be saved to the game save.  

As a result, some mods that manage kerbal naming and professions differently, ie, with a separate perist file storing this info, will "break".  To overcome this, when this option is enabled, there is a button in the roster window that appears, allowing you to revert your kerbals, and remove the extra characters, thereby allowing the other mods to work. Their names will remain the same, but their professions will be reverted to whatever they would normally be with the default KSP profession generator.
