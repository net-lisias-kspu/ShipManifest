The Roster window is accessible from either the toolbar in the Space Center, or from a button on the Manifest window when in flight.  It provides you a means to edit your kerbals.   Thinkgs like stupidity, courage, gender, profession and even their name can be altered, depending on your settings.  

If your realism settings are off, you can add a kerbal to your ship in flight .  You can also remove a kerbal from a vessel in flight as well.

With realism on, you can only edit kerbals that are Available.  If you have dead or missing kerbals, you can "resurrect them" and make them available again.
