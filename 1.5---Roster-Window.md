**Roster Window**

The Roster window is accessible from either the toolbar in the Space Center, or from a button on the Manifest window when in flight.  It provides you a means to edit your kerbals.   Things like stupidity, courage, gender, profession and even their name can be altered, depending on your settings.  

If you have the DeepFreeze mod installed, any frozen kerbals will also be listed as Frozen, along with the vessel in which they are contained.

If your realism settings are off, you can add a kerbal to your ship in flight .  You can also remove a kerbal from a vessel in flight as well.

You can only edit kerbals that are Available.  If you have dead or missing kerbals, you can "resurrect them" and make them available again.

**Add a Kerbal to an Active Vessel**  
You must have Realism off and be in Flight to perform this action.  To add a kerbal, be sure you have a kerbal with a status of available.  There will be an Add button to the right of the Edit button. Select Crew in the Manifest Window.  In the source part list, select the part where you want the kerbal to go.  The Add button will now Activate.  Click Add.  The kerbal will now be assigned to the vessel, and the Portraits will update.

**DeepFreeze Integration - Freeze/Thaw Kerbals**  
With the release of the latest version of DeepFreeze, SM now supports Freezing and thawing kerbals when placed in a DeepFreezer part on your active vessel.  

*To freeze a kerbal, xfer them to the DeepFreeze part, and then click on Freeze action button in the roster window.  
*To Thaw a kerbal simply click on the Thaw action button in the Roster window.  

Note that the Freeze and Thaw options are only available when in flight, and the active vessel contains a Freezer part.

**Create a Kerbal**  
To Create a Kerbal, click on Create.  You will be presented with a Choice of professions to chose from.  Click the profession you want and then click Create.  The create Kerbal Section appear below the Roster List.  If Enable Kerbal Renaming is ON, then the Kerbal's Name will appear in a text box.  If not, then you will see the name as a label, and it will not be editable.

If Rename with profession is on, the editor will give you the option to change the profession.  If not, the profession will be a label and cannot be changed.  Edit the properties, and click Apply.

**Editing a Kerbal**  
Editing a kerbal requires that the Kerbal be in Available status in the Roster, which enables the Edit button.  Click on Edit, and the Edit section appears (Looks just like the Create section above).  change the properties to what you desire and click Apply.

**Notes on Renaming a Kerbal**  
Enable Renaming Kerbals must be enabled in settings to use this feature.  Renaming kerbals can result in their profession changing, depending on the name chosen.  With the release of KSP 1.0.5, the profession is now persisted to the game save.  KSP now uses the hash based on the Kerbal's name to determine the profession when first created.  We now have native support for renaming and changing professions without any kind of hack.  SM now removes any extra characters left over from previous versions, and saves the current profession on update.  

To rename a Kerbal they must be in Available status in the Roster, which enables the Edit button.  Click on Edit, and the Edit section appears (Looks just like the Create section above).  change the name to what you desire and click Apply.

**Notes on Changing Professions**  
With the release of KSP 1.0.5, the profession is now persisted to the game save.   the hack described as follows applies to SM versions 4.4.1.1 and earlier.  Version 4.4.2.0 supports native renaming and profession management.

**Legacy Renaming and Professions**
If you wish to retain your profession when you change the name or just want to be able to change the profession of an existing kerbal, then Enable Rename with Profession must be enabled.  Note that when you change professions, in order to retain the name, I use non printing characters (Ascii "1"s) added to the end of the name to "fool" the hash based profession generator built into KSP to pick the desired profession.  While this causes no issues with the game, it will be saved to the game save.  

**Reverting Game Save (uninstalling Profession Management)**  
Some other mods manage kerbal naming and professions differently, ie, with a separate persist file.  Changes made in SM will not be properly stored to this file and info will become stale, breaking the other mod.  

To overcome this, when this option is enabled, there is a button in the roster window that appears, allowing you to revert your kerbals and remove the extra characters at the end of their name, thereby allowing the other mods to work. Their names will remain the same, but their professions will be changed to whatever they would normally be with the name they currently have.
