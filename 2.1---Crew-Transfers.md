**Crew Transfers**  
![](http://i.imgur.com/oDHlNfo.png)

Crew transfers are possible when Enable Crew Transfers is ON in Settings.

You can move a kerbal from seat to seat within the same part, or transfer a kerbal to another part within your vessel.  if the target part (or seat) if full, then the source kerbal will swap places with the first kerbal in the target part (or seat).

Realism Mode affects transfers as follows:  
Realism On:  
1.  Transfers will take approximately 7 seconds (configurable in the SMSettings.dat file).
2.  There are sounds of crew moving through the vessel. Volume can be adjusted in the SMSettings.dat file
3.  With CLS installed and enabled, Crew transfers can only occur between parts located within the same living space.

Realism Off:  
1.  Transfers will take place immediately.  (no waiting).
2.  There are no sounds sounds of crew moving through the vessel.
3.  Crew transfers can occur between any attached parts within the same vessel (No EVA needed ever!).

Ship Manifest also can override the stock Crew Transfer experience.  With Realism ON and Override Stock Crew transfers ON, stock crew transfers will work as follows.  
- The kerbals will be prevented from moving immediately.
- The 7 second transfer delay will occur
- the sounds of kerbals moving will occur.

**Performing a Seat to Seat Transfer within the same part**  
To move a kerbal to another seat within the same part, there is a button to the left of the Kerbal's name ">>".  Clicking this button will cause the kerbal to move to the next seat in the part (by seat index).  If there is a kerbal in that seat, the 2 kerbals will "swap places".

**Performing a Part to Part Transfer**  
First you must have a source part and a target part selected.  Once you do, a button to the right of the Kerbal's name called "Xfer" will be visible.  If a kerbal can be moved, this button will be active.  If not, then the button will be disabled (grayed out), and the tooltip (if tooltips are active) will tell you why the transfer cannot occur.

Click on the Xfer button to move a kerbal.  The Xfer buttons will gray out during the transfer process.  Once the transfer is complete, the Portraits at the lower right of the KSP screen will refresh, and the buttons will again be active.
