**Crew Transfers**  
![](http://i.imgur.com/oDHlNfo.png)

Crew transfers are possible when Enable Crew Transfers is ON in Settings.

You can move a kerbal from seat to seat within the same part, or transfer a kerbal to another part within your vessel.  if the target part (or seat) if full, then the source kerbal will swap places with the first kerbal in the target part (or seat).

Realism Mode affects transfers as follows:

1.  With realism On, transfers will take approximately 7 seconds (configurable in the SMSettings.dat file).
2.  With realism On, there are sounds of crew moving through the vessel. Volume can be adjusted in the SMSettings.dat file
3.  With Realism On, and CLS installed and enabled, Crew transfers can only occur between parts located within the same living space.

Additionally, Stock Crew transfers (using the Crew Dialog from a Part's crew hatch) are affected by Realism Mode and CLS.  with Realism ON and Override Stock Crew transfers ON, stock crew transfers follow the same rules above.
