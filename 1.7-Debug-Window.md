The Debug window will appear under 2 conditions:

1.  If Enable SM Debug Window On Error is on and an error occurs, or 
2.  When Enable Debug Window in the Settings window is set to ON.

It can be accessed via the Settings window in the Space Center, or via the settings window while in Flight. Once on, it is visible across all scenes except the loading scene and the Main Menu scene.

The Debug window contains 3 buttons at the bottom:

1.  Clear Log
2.  Save Log. that allow for saving the contents of the message log, and 
3.  Close.  This button can also be used to close the debug log along with the button at the upper right of the window.

This window's header also contains the current version number for Ship manifest.
