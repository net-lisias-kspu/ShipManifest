Ship Manifest offers you the ability to tailor the way it behaves to meet the need of many different playing styles.  Some players demand a realistic playing environment, and do not wish to take advantage of what would not be realistically possible in "real Life".  Other players simply want to play the game, and wish to use "cheats" if you will, to make the gaming experience more enjoyable, and to overcome failures when learning different features of the game.

Ship Manifest offers in the Realism section the means to limit what you can do with the mod.

The different options are described in detail below:

- **Enable Realism Mode** (on by default).  This mode cause several changes to occur in Ship Manifest.  first, several features become restricted, and some features are completely hidden.  Realism mode is detailed in section 2.
- **Enable Crew Xfers**.  This option will make Crew a selectable option in the manifest window's list of resources.  Turn it off, and you cannot transfer crew using SM.
- **Override stock Crew Xfers**.  This option is dependent on Enable Crew Xfers, and is not available if Enable Crew Xfers is off.  This option provides for SM controlled Crew Transfers when using the stock Transfer Tweakable available in the Crew dialog when clicking on a Crew Hatch.
- **Enable CLS (Connected Living Spaces**.  This option is also dependent on the state of Enable Crew Xfers.  This option will enable "space aware" transfers, meaning that IF 2 parts are connected internally and the crew "could" travel inside the vessel, then the crew transfer is possible in SM.  Note that with realism Off, this setting is ignored, and crew can be Xferred anywhere in the vessel.
- **Enable Science Xfers**.  This setting makes Science appear in the Manifest window resource selection list.  When off, Science is not listed and Science Xfers are not possible.
- **Enable Resource Xfers**.  This option allows Electric Charge and all fluid/gaseous resources to be visible in the Resource Selection List.  Turn it off and you cannot xfer any of these resources in SM.
- **Enable Resources in Pre-Flight**. With Enable Resource Xfers on, this option will turn on the ability to Fill/Dump resources Vessel wide when on the Launch pad.  This is useful for determining a dry weight of your vessel.
- **Enable Resource Xfer Costs**.  This option will cause the transfer of liquid/gaseous resources to cost ElectricCharge (for running pumps, etc) when a resource is xferred.
- **Resource Flo Cost**.  This text box allows you to configure the cost of moving resources.   it is a fixed cost per unit of resource.
- **Resource Flow rate**.  This text box sets the speed in which resources are moved in Units/Second.  There is a slider below this text box that allows you to  quickly move across a range of values.
- **-Min Flow Rate**.  This text box sets the minimum value in the slider above.
- **-Max Flow Rate**.  This text box sets the maximum value in the slider above.
- **-Max Flow Time**.  This text box sets the maximum number of seconds a transfer should take.  This is used when working with stations, and large volumes of a resource require moving.  If the calculated time to move a resource at the selected flow rate exceeds this value, then the flow rate will automatically be adjusted to ensure that all resources are moved withing the maximum time value set here.
- **Lock Settings**.  This option is special.  For those players that ABSOLUTELY do not wish to cheat AND do not trust themselves resist temptation, set this value to ON.  When set to ON, all realism settings are instantly locked, and cannot be changed from the Settings Menu, INCLUDING Lock Settings.  To disable Lock Settings, you MUST go into the SMSettings.dat file located in your GameData\ShipManifest\Plugins\PluginData folder to change the value. In other words, you have to exit the game to do this.
