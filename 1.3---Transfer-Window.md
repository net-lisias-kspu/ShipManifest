**Transfer Window**

![](http://i.imgur.com/EK87NS9.png)

The Transfer Window is where the bulk of your work will be accomplished.  Each resource type has a specific set of tasks available to it.  The Transfer window is broken into 4 main sections.   

1.  Upper left:  Source part selection section.
2.  Upper right: Target part selection section.
3.  Lower left:  Source actions section.
4.  Lower right: Target actions section.

Source and target part selection works generally the same for each resource, but with this distinction.  Since multi part transfers are possible with liquid and gaseous resources, the part selector will allow multiple part buttons to be selected.  With crew, Science and Electric Charge, only one button can be active on each side (Source/Target) at a time.  They work as toggles, meaning if you click on a previously selected part, it will be deselected.

Each resource Type has different actions available to it.  Crew and resource Xfers are bi-directional  This means you can transfer crew from the source side to the target side, or from the target side to the source side.

Science Transfers are unique, in that they are the only resource type that cannot be Transferred bidirectionally.  They can only be Transferred from Source to target.

When you mouse over a part in either the source or target list, the part associated with that button will highlight.  If edge highlighting is enabled, the part will also have a"glowing" effect around the part.  This makes part identification very easy, even in a very busy station or vessel.  To see Edge highlighting, Edge highlighting must also be enabled in KSP's settings.

More on this when we discuss each type of transfer operation in Section 2 of this Wiki.
