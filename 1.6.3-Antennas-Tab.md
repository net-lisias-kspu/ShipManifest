**Control Window, Antennas Tab**

The Antennas Tab lists all deployable Antennas on your vessel.

Retracting an Antenna will stow that part, and no communication can be initiated or limited range communications are available, depending on the antenna.  Extending an Antenna will deploy it, and allow proper communications to be established when the target is in line of sight.

When you mouse over an Antenna in the Antennas Tab, the corresponding Antenna on your vessel is highlighted.  This makes it easier to find a particular Antenna from the Control Window.

At the bottom of the Tab control, there are two buttons for Extending / Retracting all Antennas.
