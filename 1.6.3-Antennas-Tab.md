**Control Window, Antennas Tab**

The Antennas Tab lists all deployable Antennas on your vessel.

Retracting an Antenna will stow that part, and no communication can be initiated or limited range communications are available, depending on the antenna.  Extending an Antenna will deploy it, and allow proper communications to be established when the target is in line of sight.

When you mouse over an Antenna in the Antennas Tab, the corresponding Antenna on your vessel is highlighted.  This makes it easier to find a particular Antenna from the Control Window.  If edge highlighting is enabled, the part will also have a"glowing" effect around the part.  This makes part identification very easy, even in a very busy station or vessel.  To see Edge highlighting, Edge highlighting must also be enable in KSP's settings.

At the bottom of the Tab control, there are two buttons for Extending / Retracting all Antennas.

**RemoteTech Compatibility**  
SM has been modified to detect and control RemoteTech Antennas.  There is one current limitation:  The command queue for the command computer is not yet integrated.  Commands to extend and retract antennas from SM are executed immediately.   Plans are to add this capability in an upcoming release, as RemoteTech now exposes as of version 1.6.4) inserting commands into the command computer via their API,
